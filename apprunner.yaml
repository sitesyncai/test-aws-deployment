# This section tells App Runner HOW to run your application AFTER it's been built.
run:
  # The command to start your application inside the container.
  # This should match the CMD in your Dockerfile, but it's good practice to be explicit.
  command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

  # The network port your application listens on.
  # This MUST match the port in the command above and the EXPOSE in your Dockerfile.
